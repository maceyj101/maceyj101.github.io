            <h4>Brian Daniel's father was an architect and builder so it is no surprise he became a design/build contractor.  Having studied Construction Management at East Carolina University, Brian entered the field as an engineer and quickly moved into construction management for several area builders. </h4>
            <h4>Brain Daniel Construction was formed in 2006 to specialize in custom construction and remodeling of coastal homes.  As a design/build firm, BDC provides design and CAD services as well as turn key construction services.  Because of his engineering background, Brian is uniquely able to provide accurate quotes based on a 360 view of the project.  BDC does not utilize square foot estimating which can lead to surprises for the customer once a project is started.  Brian's goal is to make the building or remodeling process less stressful at every stage.
            </h4>
            <h4>Brian Daniel grew up in the area and understands the coastal environment. Whether it be building a new home, renovating a kitchen or bath, adding a deck or patio or repairing weather damage, he strives to build coastal perfection.  His experienced contractors bring a high level of professionalism to every project.
