          <div class="review1">"You have proven to be the consummate professional, with a wonderful architectural eye, and a stickler for detail.  You took a sketch and turned into so much more than I had ever hoped for.  So this is not just a "thank you," but a letter of recommendation for anyone considering using Brian Daniel Construction as their building contractor."</div>
          <div class="review2">"Miss Jean and I can't thank you enough for the marvelous results you achieved on our home renovation project, which culminated today, under budget and on schedule.  Months ago, when we selected you to be our contractor from a number of candidates, we were confident, reinforced by your past work and your outspokenly satisfied customers, that you were the best builder for us.  You and your high-quality subcontractor's efforts exceeded our expectations, producing the home we envisioned and doing it better than we thought it could be done."</div>
          <div class="review3">"To think back over the problems we had re: design, projected cost, architect bill and being told 'that can't be done' by others.  Then you told us it could be done within our projected budget - and proving it by your actions and those of your subcontractors.  You proved to us that we definately made the right choice in choosing your company.."</div>
