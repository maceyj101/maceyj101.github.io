          <div class="testHead">What Our Customers Have to Say</div>
          <div class="review1 testimonial">"You have proven to be the consummate professional, with a wonderful architectural eye, and a stickler for detail.  You took a sketch and turned into so much more than I had ever hoped for.  So this is not just a "thank you," but a letter of recommendation for anyone considering using Brian Daniel Construction as their building contractor. - Jane Tindall from Beaufort, NC</div>
          <div class="review2 testimonial">"Miss Jean and I can't thank you enough for the marvelous results you achieved on our home renovation project, which culminated today, under budget and on schedule.  Months ago, when we selected you to be our contractor from a number of candidates, we were confident, reinforced by your past work and your outspokenly satisfied customers, that you were the best builder for us.  You and your high-quality subcontractor's efforts exceeded our expectations, producing the home we envisioned and doing it better than we thought it could be done." -  Jean and John Macheca from Pine Knoll Shores, NC</div>
          <div class="review3 testimonial">"To think back over the problems we had re: design, projected cost, architect bill and being told 'that can't be done' by others.  Then you told us it could be done within our projected budget - and proving it by your actions and those of your subcontractors.  You proved to us that we definately made the right choice in choosing your company." - Tom and Edwina Webster from Eden, NC</div>
          <div class="review4 testimonial">"We have built 5 homes in 3 states, and working with Brian was easily the most pleasant of our home building experiences.  He is a true professional and the result has more than met our expectation.  One real benefit was that Brian was both designer and builder, so he fully understood the intent of the design and we avoided any architect-builder misunderstandings.  We would definitely build with Brian again and highly recommend him to anyone considering building a custom home." - Claudia and Robert Kelsey</div>
          <div class="review5 testimonial">"The decision to use Brian Daniel Construction has proved to be the right choice.  Being very detailed about construction integrity, wind driven rain and overall quality due to the coastal location, Brian could not have been better.  Brian was professional, knowledgeable, experienced and simply pleasant to work with.  His honesty and attention to detail was the best." - Tom Glasgow from Morehead City, NC</div>
